# Week 3 Assignment - Password Generator

## Description

This project requires a Password Generator to be calibrated so that the user is given a series of criteria to apply that which the programme can use to return a randomly generated password.

The length of the password is first gathered with a PROMPT WINDOW in order to get a specific number. If the input is outisde the acceptance criteria the prompt will specify the range (8-128) for the user to input, and only proceed when an acceptable number is added. Then a series of confirm windows determine what attributes the user wants the password to have (upper or lower case letters, numbers or special characters) and the responses added to the end of an array.
